// The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement.

const x = 10; 

const color = x > 10 ? 'red' : 'blue';

switch(color) {
  case 'red':
    console.log('color is red');
    break;
  case 'blue':
    console.log('color is blue');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('color is NOT red or blue');
    break;
}
