const name = 'Vasile'; //String
const age = 27; // Number
const rating = 4.5; // Number decimal
const isCool = true; // Boolean
const x = null; // NUll, however in console log returns object. ! null is not an object, it is a primitive value. For example, you cannot add properties to it. Sometimes people wrongly assume that it is an object, because typeof null returns "object". But that is actually a bug (that might even be fixed in ECMAScript 6).
const y = undefined; //Undefined 
let z; //undefined

console.log(typeof x);
